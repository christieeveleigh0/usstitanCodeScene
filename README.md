Once upon a time,  
there was a toy robot named "Hal".  
Hal enjoyed teaching little kids how to program and running around in mazes.

One bright sunny day,  
Hal decided to run around in a proceduraly generated maze.  
Poor Hal got so lost he found himself in a strange dark world...

Just as he was about to give up and say: "I am lost" - three robots appear in the distance!  

Hal rushes to them with great joy and says: "Greetings! My name is-"   
_BRRRRAaaaah! SMAsh! BOOOM!_

Bomber-Berri, Sniper-Shaq and Tanker-Titi had reduced Hal to scrap before he could complete his sentence.

The end.
